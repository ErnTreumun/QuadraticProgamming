# QuadraticProgamming
In this repository, I present a project addressing a discrete quadratic control problem applied on electric converters.
In folder "images" you have two sub-folders, the subfolder "New Images" has the images with Frank-Wolfe non Step algorithm, and "Project" the images which were added on the project.
